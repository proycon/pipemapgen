A small toy project; procedural generation of an interconnected network of pipes/roads/subways/hallways or whatever you see in it.

Properties:
* No isolated subgraphs.
* Two classes of pipes, a 'backbone' or set of core pipes (thicker) vs 'regular'
* Simple visualisation (using unicode block drawing) to standard output
